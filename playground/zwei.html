    <td><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">With their hypnotic animated loops, 
      nostalgia laden computer sounds and leftfield humour, Friendchip create 
      deceptively simple internet art that entertains and entrances. To celebrate 
      the successful delivery of Scene Online we asked them to build an art site 
      based on the theme of 'birth'. The site should also capture the spirit of 
      irreverence, beauty and creative freedom that Playground, and Scene as a 
      whole, is all about. </font> 
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Musical cubes which 'sing' when 
        you touch them. The Rolf Harris Stylophone revisited. Freeman's catalogue 
        figures 'making love' in a sterile Tron world. Silicon-chip-motorway haiku. 
        The chance to build the tower block of your dreams. It's birth, but not 
        as we know it. And the only way to understand it is to play with it. Warning: 
        evil geniuses at work...</font> </p>

      about?<br>
      <b>Friendchip#1:</b> I was doing traditional graphic design stuff for TV and advertising. I just wanted to do something a bit different and stumbled into the web 
      thing without really having any agenda - other than to have fun with it.<br>
      <b>Friendchip#0:</b> The web design came about because I was doing various part-time 
      jobs: van driving and being a chef and stuff. Web design seemed more interesting 
      so I did an evening course and here I am.</font></td>

      we saw on the back of a Kraftwerk album and we just kind of liked it. Then

      lo-fi. Why?<br>
      <b>Friendchip#1:</b><i> </i>I've got a bit of a thing about old photocopiers - 
      my print work is kind of based around that black and white, blocky style. 
      We took a similar approach to the internet stuff. And we didn't have a scanner 
      at the beginning so we had to render all the images ourselves.<br>
      <b>Friendchip#0:</b> Also, when we started out we got given a couple of dodgy old 
      PCs that were being thrown out of my dad's work. <br>
      </font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><b>Friendchip#1:</b> We still run 
      all our stuff on a crappy, really basic PC, so it needs to be simple. We 
      want it to work on whatever computer you've got.<br>

        this e-mail back saying, 'Looked at your site and didn't get the right

        that, the internet has suddenly become this big money-making thing. What
