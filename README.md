# friendchip

This collection of html and flash files used to be the website friendchip.com. It stopped working when flash players stopped working, and had been slowly dying for a while before as the technologies it was built with dropped out of use. 

## Restoration

It's been possible to think about resurrecting this stuff due to [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs), which has done an amazing job of creating an open source version of the flash player that works on modern browsers and avoids the problems of the old commercial player. There will be some changes to the html pages containing the flash files to get it working but I'll try to keep things as they are as much as possible. Might even leave some html tags in BLOCK CAPITALS.
